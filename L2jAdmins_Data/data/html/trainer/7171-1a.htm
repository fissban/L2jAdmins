 <tr><td>I have nothing to teach you. Maybe you'll find who </td></tr><tr><td>you're looking for upstairs? Even though Gauen is </td></tr><tr><td>younger than other Elves, he is a fine teacher. Kaiena is </td></tr><tr><td>quite hard to deal with but is a great Mystic.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>This place has no teachings for Clerics so, if you are </td></tr><tr><td>one, I suggest you look for the temple.</td></tr>
