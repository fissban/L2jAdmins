Welcome! Come in! Let me guess! You want me to build something for you! Ahem! It's great to have one's skills so in demand, but it can be a nuissance to be so famous! Basically, I'm a jack of all trades! I can make almost anything! Ha! However, I can't squander my talents on just anyone ...<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine... Understand? Nothing comes free in this world, right? Ha! What do you have to offer?<br>
