 Blacksmith Silvera:<br>
 Hey, nice to meet you. I am Blacksmith Silvery. It's so cold these days! Make sure you keep yourself warm. So many people have applied for the Artisan test that I'm very, very busy. Are you applying too? Did you come here to learn skills or do you need something else?<br>
