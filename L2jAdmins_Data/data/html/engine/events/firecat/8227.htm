Buzz the Cat:<br>
Meow! Nice to meet you! I'm Buzz the Cat, a faithful servant of the Great Magus Ahuron Raulian!<br>
He is among the foremost magi of the Ivory Tower, but is quite inexperienced in the ways of love...<br>
Recently he looked up from his magazine and exclaimed, "Eureka, this is it!". When I looked to see what he meant, I saw it was an article entitled <font color="LEVEL">"Win your Lover's Heart with Dazzling Sparkles!"</font>... <br>
My master immediately set about covering the entire continent with magnificent glittering lights and preparing Fireworks! Meow! Personally, I think he's taking this too far... <br>
We, his faithful feline servants, have come here to organize the <font color="LEVEL">Playing with Fire Event</font>! Meow!<br>
<a action="bypass -h Engine FireCat info">"Tell me about the event."</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Engine FireCat create">"I want to create a Firework."</a>
