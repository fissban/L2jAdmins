Fishermen's Guild Member Monakan:<br>
Hi there! I'm Monakan, a member of the Fishermen's Guild.<br>
I sell fishing supplies and teach fishing techniques to all levels of fishermen. Bring me the fish you catch and I'll pay you for it! Basically, when it comes to fishing, I'm the one to see! Ha!<br>
