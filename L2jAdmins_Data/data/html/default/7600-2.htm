 <tr><td>Always keep your mind fixed on the ultimate</td></tr><tr><td>goad! War has brought chaos to the realms of</td></tr><tr><td>Men, and chaos is our natural element. We</td></tr><tr><td>seek to make use of this chaos to advance our</td></tr><tr><td>race and bury the sun dwellers.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>But first things first. Begin by mastering the</td></tr><tr><td>weapons and armour you have now. Go hunt</td></tr><tr><td>keltirs or wolves around the village. When you</td></tr><tr><td>find weapons or armour on the monsters you</td></tr><tr><td>slay, try to use them yourself. Items which are</td></tr><tr><td>usless to you may be sold at a shop, to</td></tr><tr><td>finance your futher adventures.</td></tr><br>
