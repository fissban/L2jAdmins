 <tr><td>Lighthouse Keeper Rocksewll:</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins to</td></tr><tr><td>the sea, but times have changed and there is</td></tr><tr><td>no sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, we</td></tr><tr><td>set afloat a boat that contains a doll in the</td></tr><tr><td>shape of a Human maiden. Now we have to</td></tr><tr><td>make that doll.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>I've asked Warehouse Keeper Rolfe, who is</td></tr><tr><td>handy with his hands, to make the doll, but we</td></tr><tr><td>still have to make the dolls long hair. For that, I</td></tr><tr><td>need high quality fur yarn.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Hunt the keltris on the island and gather about</td></tr><tr><td>ten bundles of fur, then take them to Cristle in</td></tr><tr><td>the next village. You can find her at the well in</td></tr><tr><td>front of the village warehouse. Give the fur to</td></tr><tr><td>Cristal, and she will spin it into yarn. Take the</td></tr><tr><td>yarn and give it to Warehouse Keeper Rolfe. He</td></tr><tr><td>will probably finish the doll on the spot. As</td></tr><tr><td>soon as the doll is finished, bring it back to me.</td></tr><tr><td>I will give you a generous reward for your labor.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><br>
