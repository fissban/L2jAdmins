 <tr><td>If you have powerful companions, they may</td></tr><tr><td>purchase equipment for you. Otherwise,</td></tr><tr><td>equipment for novices is provided by the</td></tr><tr><td>Temple of Shilen.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>For now, you should seek to master the arms</td></tr><tr><td>and armour you already possess. You will</td></tr><tr><td>sometimes obtain arms and armor from the</td></tr><tr><td>monsters you hunt. With some luck, you may</td></tr><tr><td>acquire <font color="LEVEL">cloth shoes, apprentice's shoes, or a</font></td></tr><tr><td><font color="LEVEL">cloth cap.</font></td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>The temple will provide you with two different</td></tr><tr><td>blades, a <font color="LEVEL"> dagger</font> and a squire's sword. The</td></tr><tr><td>dagger is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while</td></tr><tr><td>the squire's sword (one-handed sword) is</td></tr><tr><td>noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes</td></tr><tr><td>with greater accuracy. Remember that different</td></tr><tr><td>weapons may call upon different skills in their</td></tr><tr><td>use.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Return to me when you have achieved <font color="LEVEL">level 6.</font></td></tr><tr><td>and I will teach you more about weapons.</td></tr><br>
