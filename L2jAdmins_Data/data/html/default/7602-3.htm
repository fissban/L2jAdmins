 <tr><td>I suppose you're using the weapons and armour</td></tr> <tr><td>you were issued by the Priests of Paagrio,</td></tr> <tr><td>That's unless you have rich friends, of course,</td></tr> <tr><td>eh?</td></tr><tr><td>Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember</td></tr> <tr><td>to pay attention to what you find while hunting</td></tr> <tr><td>monsters - you can find armour, and sometimes</td></tr> <tr><td>even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you</td></tr> <tr><td>might find <font color="LEVEL">cloth shoes, apprentice's shoes, or</font></td></tr> <tr><td><font color="LEVEL">a cloth cap</font>.</td></tr><tr><td>You should have been given two weapons, a</td></tr> <tr><td>squire's sword and training gloves. Even a</td></tr> <tr><td>novice like you can tell the difference between</td></tr> <tr><td>a sword and a brawling weapon, I think. The</td></tr> <tr><td><font color="LEVEL">training gloves (hand-to-hand weapon)</font> hit</td></tr><tr><td>twice as often as other weapons, but they're</td></tr> <tr><td>not as powerful. Plus, you need both hands, so</td></tr> <tr><td>forget about a shield. Now the squire's sword</td></tr> <tr><td>(one-handed sword) is much sower than the</td></tr> <tr><td>gloves, but is more accurate and does more</td></tr> <tr><td>damage. Remember that different weapons may</td></tr> <tr><td>call upon different skills in their use. Either is a</td></tr> <tr><td>worth weapon - it is up to you to decide</td></tr> <tr><td>which suits you best.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Come back when you reach <font color="LEVEL">level 6</font> and</td></tr> <tr><td>we'll talk more about weapons.</td></tr>
