 <tr><td>You should have been given two weapons - a</td></tr> <tr><td><font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> and a squire's sword. Perhaps you</td></tr> <tr><td>have already noticed that daggers and swords</td></tr> <tr><td>perform differently in battle. The dagger is</td></tr> <tr><td>swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the</td></tr> <tr><td>squire's sword is noticeably slower than the</td></tr> <tr><td>dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy.</td></tr> <tr><td>Remember that different weapons may call</td></tr> <tr><td>upon different skills in their use. Either is a</td></tr> <tr><td>worthy weapon; it is up to you to decide which</td></tr> <tr><td>suits you best. When you have saved around</td></tr> <tr><td>500 adena, buy a bone dagger if that's what</td></tr> <tr><td>you prefer, or a short sword if swords are more</td></tr> <tr><td>to your taste.</td></tr><tr><td>You may be able to improve your armour from</td></tr> <tr><td>the spoils of te monsters you slay, but that is</td></tr><tr><td>a matter of luck. If you reach level 5 and are</td></tr><tr><td>still lacking gloves, shoes or a helmet, you</td></tr><tr><td>should consider purchasing the cheapest ones</td></tr><tr><td>offered by the store.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>When you reach level 6 return to me, and we</td></tr><tr><td>will speak of this subject in more depth.</td></tr><br>
