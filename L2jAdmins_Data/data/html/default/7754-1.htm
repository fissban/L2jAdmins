 Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
 The core of the magic force field is a gateway that was created by those who locked away Antharas. A <font color="LEVEL">portal stone </font>acts as a key to enter it. Another <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman, Theodric</font> is in charge of the portal stone and gives it only to authorized seal watchers. <br>
 If you wish to get a hold of a portal stone, first go to see seal watcher Gabrielle. After you have been approved by her, come back and see me.<br>
