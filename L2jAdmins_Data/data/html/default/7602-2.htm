 <tr><td>It's never too early to think about your</td></tr> <tr><td>long-term goals. The Kingdom of Aden is in</td></tr> <tr><td>chaos, because they are at war with Elmore to</td></tr> <tr><td>the north and Gracia across the sea.</td></tr> <tr><td>Remember, <font color="LEVEL">there are alwyas opportunities</font></td></tr> <tr><td><font color="LEVEL">during times of chaos</font>. You're just a novice</td></tr> <tr><td>grunt now, but it's your duty to become a great</td></tr> <tr><td>hero and restore the Orc race to supremacy.</td></tr> <br>
<br>
 <br>
 <tr><td>You must begin by familiarizing yourself with</td></tr> <tr><td>the gear you already have. Whether you seek</td></tr> <tr><td>to become a dragon slayer or the commander</td></tr> <tr><td>of a great horde of Orcs, it all begins with your</td></tr> <tr><td>training here.</td></tr><tr><td>Start out by hunting crimson keltirs or kasha</td></tr> <tr><td>wolves around the village. When you find items</td></tr> <tr><td>left behind by the monsters you slay, try</td></tr> <tr><td>equipping the armour and weapons, to see if</td></tr> <tr><td>they're better than what you already have. If</td></tr> <tr><td>you have no other use for them, you can</td></tr> <tr><td>always sell them at a shop.</td></tr> <br>
