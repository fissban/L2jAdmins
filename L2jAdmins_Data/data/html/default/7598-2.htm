<tr><td>Its never too early to think about your</td></tr><tr><td>long-term goals. The Kingdom of Aden is in</td></tr><tr><td>chaos, because they are at war with Elmore to</td></tr><tr><td>the north and Gracia across the sea,</td></tr><tr><td>Rember, there are always opportunities</td></tr><tr><td>during times of chaos. Now you are merely a</td></tr><tr><td>novice Fighter, but if you train hard and learn</td></tr><tr><td>much, there is nothing to stop you from</td></tr><tr><td>becoming a Lord or a King</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>You must begin by familiarizing yourself with</td></tr><tr><td>the gear you already have. Whether you seek</td></tr><tr><td>to become a dragon slayer or the Lord of a</td></tr><tr><td>castle, or even a force for world peace, it all</td></tr><tr><td>begins with your training here.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Start out by hunting keltris or wolves arround</td></tr><tr><td>the village. When you find an item left behind</td></tr><tr><td>by a monster you slay, try equipping the armour</td></tr><tr><td>or weapon, and see if it's better than what you</td></tr><tr><td>already have. If you have no other use for it,</td></tr><tr><td>you can always sell it at the shop.</td></tr><br>
