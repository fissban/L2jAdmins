 <tr><td>Enlightenment is followed by sacrifice. If you</td></tr><tr><td>look back on the history of our race, you will</td></tr><tr><td>truly relize the truth of this teaching. When</td></tr><tr><td>the <font color="LEVEL"> Great Sorcerer Dasparion</font> came to us a</td></tr><tr><td>thousand years ago and proposed to teach us</td></tr><tr><td>black magic, we did not anticipate the sacrifice</td></tr><tr><td>we would have to pay in the future and</td></tr><tr><td>accepted his proposal.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>When we were at war the Elves of the</td></tr><tr><td>light, the black magic spells we cast wiped out</td></tr><tr><td>the innocent Elves of the trees, due to</td></tr><tr><td>Dasparion's malicous plots. While the Elves of</td></tr><tr><td>the trees died, they cursed us with all teir</td></tr><tr><td>remaining strength. As a result, our beautiful</td></tr><tr><td>forest withered, our skin became scorched by</td></tr><tr><td>the sun, we went blind and became the</td></tr><tr><td>race of the Dark. For hundreds of years, we</td></tr><tr><td>lived hidden underground.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Now the curse of the Dark EDlves has been</td></tr><tr><td>broken and we live above the ground, but we</td></tr><tr><td>must not forget the high price we paid to earn</td></tr><tr><td>strength.</td></tr><br>
