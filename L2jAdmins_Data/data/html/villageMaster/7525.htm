 Head Blacksmith Bronk:<br>
 I am Head Blacksmith Bronk of <font color="LEVEL">the Black Anvil Guild</font>. The Black Anvil Guild is a proud guild that produces many excellent Artisans and Warsmiths. A Dwarven tribe without our guild is like bread without butter, or a Dwarf with no money. So, what has brought you to me?<br>
