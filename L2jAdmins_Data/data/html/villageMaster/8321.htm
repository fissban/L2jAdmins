Grand Master Siegmund:<br>
What do you think, young man? Would you challenge the masters here just for the sake of learning a technique or two? Their teaching methods may be somewhat rough, but they're all excellent teachers.<br>
 What happens if you get injured while receiving your training? Don't worry! The magister from the library across the road will chant a healing spell over you!<br>
 Recently I've noticed many talented young people in this place. I'm very curious about what might happen here next...<br>
