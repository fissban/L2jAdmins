I've got to reorganize the entire collection of books in the<br1>
warehouse and proofread for any typos! What a day! Oh<br1>
yeha, I also need to bind some books as well! Phew! I'm<br1>
overwhelmed!<br>
Hi! Are you looking for a book? I'm very busy right now.<br1>
Why don't you look around and see if we have something<br1>
You want? Thanks!<br>
