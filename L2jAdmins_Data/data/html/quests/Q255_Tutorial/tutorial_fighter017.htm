<center><font color="LEVEL">[Learn Skill]</font></center><br>
Congratulations! You have finally reached level 5.<br>
Now you can learn a new skill. To learn a skill, you must meet the <font color="LEVEL">Master in the town.</font> Follow the arrow above your head to find him.<br>
In order to learn a skill, a certain number of <font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font> is required. Your SP will grow every time you kill a monster, so if you ever run out of SP, you can earn more by hunting monsters.<br>
To see your current SP level, open the <font color="LEVEL">Character Information Window</font>. If you click the <font color="FF0000">icon that looks like a face</font> or press the ALT+T keys, the Character Information Window will open.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img08" width=174 height=64><br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">[Penalty for Dying]</font></center><br>
From this point on, whenever your character dies, you will receive a penalty by getting some of your character's Exp reduced. Be careful so that you will not lose your valuable Exp that you have earned through hard work as a result of your character dying.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">[Benefits for New Characters]</font></center><br>
A character who has achieved level 6 for the first time among your characters will receive various <font color="LEVEL">benefits for a new character</font> such as additional quest reward, support magic etc. After that, although your other characters achieve level 6 and up, they will not receive the benefits.Therefore, make your choice carefully regarding whether you should continue growing your current character until it attains level 6 so that it can receive benefits as a new character or whether you should give up on the current character and start raising a new character.<br>
