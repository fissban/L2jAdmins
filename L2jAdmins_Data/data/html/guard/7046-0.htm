Therefore, if you</td></tr><tr><td>wander around the island carelessly, you may lose your life.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>In particular, Orcs travel around in groups so</td></tr><tr><td>you must be extra carefull of their approach.</td></tr><tr><td>Recently, there have been rumours that they are</td></tr><tr><td>frequently around the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory.</font> Be</td></tr><tr><td>carefull.</td></tr><br>
