<tr><td>Sentinel Rayen: </td></tr><br>
<tr><td>May the wind of the forest lead you to peace. I</td></tr><tr><td>am the sentinel Rayen. Our duty is to drive</td></tr><tr><td>away those who try to attack our forest and</td></tr><tr><td>village.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>The Elven Forest is no doubt our home.</td></tr><tr><td>However, we have lived in the seclusion of this</td></tr><tr><td>forest too long and I believe that living our</td></tr><tr><td>lives isolated from the outside world has made</td></tr><tr><td>us weak. I advise Elves who have learned the</td></tr><tr><td>basics of sword and spell to go out beyond the</td></tr><tr><td>forest into the land of Humans and extend</td></tr><tr><td>their knowledge. The first gateway would be</td></tr><tr><td><font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>, located to the south of the Elven</td></tr><tr><td>Forest.</td></tr><br>
