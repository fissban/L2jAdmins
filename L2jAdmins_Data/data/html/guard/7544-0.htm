 <tr><td>Hey. I'll let you in on a little secret. If you go</td></tr><tr><td>north from here, there's a great beach. When I</td></tr><tr><td>am off duty, I sometimes go there and enjoy</td></tr><tr><td>the wind. It's a good place to go with a lover,</td></tr><tr><td>but it's nice to go alone too.</td></tr><br>
