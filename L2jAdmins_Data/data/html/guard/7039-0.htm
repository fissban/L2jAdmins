<tr><td>Captain Gilbert: </td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Nice to meet you, young friend. I am Captain</td></tr><tr><td>Gilbert. Our guards maintain the peace in the</td></tr><tr><td>village and work day and night to protect the</td></tr><tr><td>residents from ferocious beasts or orcs, just</td></tr><tr><td>like the <font color="LEVEL">lighthouse</font> works constantly to protect</td></tr><tr><td>ships from the rocks.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>If you are planning to leave the village, ask the</td></tr><tr><td>guards about getting around on the island. We wouldn't</td></tr><tr><td>want you to suffer misfortune, lost in</td></tr><tr><td>a forest full of orcs and wolves.</td></tr><br>
