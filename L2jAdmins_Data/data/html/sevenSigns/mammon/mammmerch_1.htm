May you receive the blessings of Mammon! We of the Mammon Guild have come far to show you some exquisite items!<br>
Before you start shopping there are a few things I should tell you... We don't accept today's currency, but instead use only <font color="LEVEL">ancient adena</font>. Also, if you wish to purchase an enchanted scroll, you must bring a <font color="LEVEL">blank scroll</font>.<br>
