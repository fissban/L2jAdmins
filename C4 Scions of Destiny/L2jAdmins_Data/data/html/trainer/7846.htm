Ha, ha! If you think that blacksmiths make just armor, swords, spears, axes and plows... you'd be making a big miscalculation. Hey, if it weren't for the efforts of our Black Anvil artisans, even Aden Castle that stands there looking so dynamic would never have been built.<br>
And, umm, here's a rumor I've heard... Recently, a large golem has appeared that was made and sold by the Black Anvil Guild and is used by the rebel armies to defeat the human castle lords. Who could have created such a monster but the Black Anvil guild?<br>
