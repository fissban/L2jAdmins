Warehouse Chief Mona:<br>
What should the new slogan be this month? It needs to be a real humdinger! One that will attract lots of new customers... Hmm... when I looked at your face, suddenly I got a great idea!<br>
"The Adena You Earned While Risking Your Life at the Lair of Antharas. Will You Trust It With Just Anybody? Take It To The Iron Gate Warehouse! Your Most Reliable Friend, A Friend Indeed In Your Time Of Need!"<br>
What do you think? Is that great or what? What? Too long? Humph! What do you know about slogans?<br>
