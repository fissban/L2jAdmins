 <tr><td>Guard Gardner:</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>In the past it was known as the Forest of</td></tr><tr><td>Doppelgangers. Monsters there masqueraded</td></tr><tr><td>as known Men and attacked unwary victims...</td></tr><tr><td>Honestly I have never seen my doppelganger.</td></tr><tr><td>It is said the you will die instantly if you do...</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>However I am fairly sure that these monsters</td></tr><tr><td>existed in the past. Everyone knows that if you</td></tr><tr><td>hear someone following you through the woods</td></tr><tr><td>you must never look back but run away with</td></tr><tr><td>your eyes covered...</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Don't worry, no reason to believe they are still</td></tr><tr><td>around, but actually no reason to think they</td></tr><tr><td>are extinct, either... I wonder why they would</td></tr><tr><td>become extinct? If so, what sort of creatures</td></tr><tr><td>might live in the Forest of Mirrors?</td></tr>
