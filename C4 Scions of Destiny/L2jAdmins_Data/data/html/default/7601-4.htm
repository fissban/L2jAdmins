 <tr><td>Right now, you should leave the village by</td></tr><tr><td>south gate and hunt <font color="LEVEL">longtail keltirs</font>, gremlin</td></tr><tr><td>scavengers or wolves, Wolves are the most </td></tr><tr><td>dangerous, so take care, If there are too many </td></tr><tr><td>hunters on that side of the village, look to the</td></tr><tr><td>eastside of the bank after you exit the village</td></tr><tr><td>from the north gate.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>Remember, when you target a monster, its </td></tr><tr><td>name will appear at the top-center of the</td></tr><tr><td>screen. The color of the name shows how</td></tr><tr><td>difficult it is. For now, stick to creatures with</td></tr><tr><td>white or sky-blue names, The ones in red and</td></tr><tr><td>and yellow are much stronger than you, so steer</td></tr><tr><td>clear.</td></tr><br>
 <tr><td>And be ye warned,you're not ready to go</td></tr><tr><td>messing with goblins yet, They're agood deal</td></tr><tr><td>smarter and stronger than they seem. Most</td></tr><tr><td>importantly, they understand teamwork -- if one</td></tr><tr><td>goblin is in trouble, others will come to its aid.</td></tr><tr><td>So even if you're strong enough to take a</td></tr><tr><td>goblin one-on-one, you're nowhere near ready</td></tr><tr><td>to deal with two or three, Watch yourself now.</td></tr><br>
