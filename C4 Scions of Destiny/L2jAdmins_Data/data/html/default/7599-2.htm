 <tr><td>Consider where you wish to finish, and that will</td></tr> <tr><td>tell you where to start. The Kingdom of Aden is</td></tr> <tr><td>in chaos, because they are at war with Elmore,</td></tr> <tr><td>and with Gracia across the sea. What better</td></tr> <tr><td>time will there be to restore the Elven people to</td></tr> <tr><td>their ancient greatness?</td></tr><tr><td>For now, the most important thing is to simply</td></tr> <tr><td>hone your skills in combat. What could be a</td></tr> <tr><td>greater priority in this time of war?</td></tr><tr><td>Begin your training by hunting <font color="LEVEL">red keltirs</font> or</td></tr> <tr><td>wolves near the village. Be cautious,</td></tr> <tr><td>particularly with the wolves, for they are very</td></tr> <tr><td>savage. When you find an item after slaying a</td></tr> <tr><td>monster, try to equip any armour or weapon, and</td></tr> <tr><td>see if it's better than what you have now. For</td></tr> <tr><td>the rest, if you have no other use for it, sell it</td></tr> <tr><td>at the stores, so you will have adena when</td></tr> <tr><td>you need it.</td></tr> <br>
