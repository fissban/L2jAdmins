Innadril is the best place I've ever seen for fishing! There's great, warm weather in all four seasons! Nature and the city co-exist beautifully here, wouldn't you agree? There's no other place like it!<br>
Innadril exists under the divine protection of Eva, the water goddess. Now you know why they call it the city of water!<br>
