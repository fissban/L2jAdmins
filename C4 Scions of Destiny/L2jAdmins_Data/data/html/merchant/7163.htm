 Trader Rex:<br>
 I bid you welcome. Welcome to the Ivory Tower.<br>
 The Ivory Tower is generally known as the lair for Magicians but actually a lot of people who aren't also come and go. For instance, me, I was once a Paladin that took a pledge to devote myself to Einhasad. I still try to devote myself.<br>
 ...And, strange things happen at this tower, but if you think about them too much you will go crazy so don't be too nosy. It might dangerous.<br>
