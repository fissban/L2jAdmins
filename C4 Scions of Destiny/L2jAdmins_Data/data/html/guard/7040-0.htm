<tr><td>Welcome to the Talking Island Village! I am</td></tr><tr><td>Leon, one of the guards here. Our duty is to</td></tr><tr><td>protect the village from the invasion of Orcs or</td></tr><tr><td>werewolves and punish those who violate the laws of this kingdom.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Those who harm others are dealt with severely</td></tr><tr><td>according to the orders of the king. You may</td></tr><tr><td>think it is merciless, but I think that those who</td></tr><tr><td>injure others deserve the same.</td></tr><br>
