<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Pochi:<br>
Come on in. Have you come to deposit something? Or make a withdrawal? By the way, have you been to the high-end shop near here? If not, you should give it a try. It s run by a Dwarven brother of mine, named Galladucci. He's a bit of an odd ball, but he s got a good heart. You should pay him a visit. There are quite a few quality goods there.<br>
